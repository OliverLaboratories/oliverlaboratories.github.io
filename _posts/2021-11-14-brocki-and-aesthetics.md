> “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” - Fyodor Dostoevsky

When faced with a new and complex situation our natural instinct is to rapidly condense it into digestable forms.
Hence, the marked emphasis on case numbers, $R_0$, fatality rates, vaccination rates in our headlines.
These are extremely narrow proxies for well-being that have the upside being very fast to define and measure. 
Under the circumstances of a seemingly deadly pandemic, these can justifiably serve as evidence to the implementation of policies such as masking, distancing, plexiglass, vaccine coercion, etc (hereafter: _masks & co_).
While these proxies may be useful guides in times of panic, they fall severely short of ultimate object of interest: the human body and soul.
Thankfully, when afforded time to look at human side, we are land in familiar territory. 
Through the ages our cultures have gathered a great deal of wisdom about adequately serving the body and soul.
Early alarm bells were sounded by [Douglas Farrow](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2021/04/24/get-out-of-my-pub-on-vaccinating-the-young-and-other-bad-ideas/) to remind us that we are in danger of ignoring this wisdom moving forward. 
Unfortunately, [recent experience](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/will-americans-wear-masks-to-prevent-sickness-beyond-covid-19) suggests that the warnings were indeed well-placed.
Despite case numbers reaching manageable levels and vaccinations and treatments becoming widely available, masks & co. show no sign of retreat.
On pure logical grounds, this raises a red flag.
When the temporary proxies ($R_0$, case counts, etc.) implemented in times of panic no longer hold but their effects remain we must ask ourselves what has taken their place.
Here I claim we are also back in familiar territory.
It is not hard to notice that the tempatations of habit, fear, and unidimensional thinking have played themselves out at every point in our culture. 
And it is ultimately these vices that have taken the supporting role for policies, which under normal circumstances are not justifiable for their undermining of core human values.
By looking at the way we reason about moral arguments, and drawing from simple examples from my daily life I show that we ought to go back to considering a larger picture of human value if we are to avoid a fundamentally ugly future.

I begin with a very brief sketch of the framework I use to think about these questions.
Any moral decision consists in applying a choice of _values_ to a given set of _facts_.
Facts are beliefs about the current state of the world (e.g. it is raining outside, implementing policy X will reduce crime by Y).
We may have different beliefs about this state of affairs, but the state of affairs in itself exists independently of us.
This gives rise to the property of falsifiability.
Given enough evidence, we can definitively accept or reject a given belief about the state of affairs (this is the job of science).
On the other hand, values are beliefs about what the world _ought_ to look like, i.e. a desire for a possible set of facts to manifest itself. 
Therefore, by definition values cannot themselves be facts as we can't find them in the world outside of ourselves.
(Anyone who has worked in machine learning or reinforcement learning can map this distinction to features/weights and environment/policy pairs. Scientists uncover and characterize feature sets and environments, but on their own they can never tell us what loss function, weight matrix, reward mechanism or loss function to choose.) 
If a discussion is going to lead anywhere productive, this distinction should always remain clear.
The aim of this post is to identify a set of facts that ought to be included in our moral deliberations on most COVID-related policies.

Some observations on this framework (can be skipped).

1. In any situation, the set of possible facts is infinite and our mental bandwith is severely finite. This means that we will never be able to make a decision based on a complete knowledge of the state of affairs, and any decision we come to will be necessarily biased and suboptimal with a high probability. Discussion and open mindedness are our only hope at improving our decision making processes.
2. In my experience spending most of time with scientists, the failure to distinguish between these two elements is a temptation that leads to the 'fetishization' of science; the belief that science should be applied to domains beyond its scope.
Even outside scientific circles, I often hear the pejorative 'anti-science' being used in disagreements about _values_.
Science is a very useful mechanism for deciding the truth value for a particular set of facts, but can never say anything about what value should be assigned to it. I myself have struggled to shake the temptation of using science to decide on value sets. A science fetishist may propose a principe: we ought to choose value sets that can maximize some evidence-based measure such as survival or well-being. But on what evidence was does the principle itself stand? What evidence is there that we should enact that principle and not one where the survival of the blue jay is the sole aim?
3. We should not confuse changes in our belief of facts with changes in values. C.S. Lewis' discussion of the old practice of witch hunts comes to mind here:

> But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did - if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather - surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, these filthy quislings did? There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about a matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.

When discussing the justifiability of masks & co. I notice that discussions invariably come to an impasse and everything boils down to gut feeling or personal preference.
While this may often be a reasonable stopping place, it is always worthwile to check whether we are not instead bumping up against something fundamental for which we lack the language to discuss. 
A couple of days ago, while watching watching Wes Anderson's [The Grand Budapest Hotel]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Budapest_Hotel)) I realized the problem was I was not looking at all of the facts.

The 2014 movie depicts the life and downfall of Monsieur Gustave, a hotel concierge at the opulent Grand Budapest Hotel in fictional 1930s Austria.
Monsieur Gustave's life revolves around seeing that every detail of the hotel is packed with sophistication and beauty.
Through a series of events, Monsieur Gustave find himself in several misadventures including being chased by fascists, shootouts, prison escapes, and high speed alpine chases.
Shockingly (and of course comically in so far as humor points at truth) even in situations where survival ought to be the one and only set of facts of any value, he displays an insistence on superficial details.
One of many examples of this comes moments after Monsieur Gustave's escape from prison where he climbs out of a sewer and meets his sidekick Zero who was supposed to help him get to safety.
While clearly still under pursuit, he takes the time to ask Zero how things are going with his love interest, Agatha.
To answer the question, Zero begins to recite some romantic verse.
Midway through the poem, Monsieur Gustave hears the prison alarm and _politely_ interrupts the poem with:

> Very good! I'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded. But remember where you left off because I insist you finish later.

This is someone who is either foolish to be wasting a precious head start in a deadly foot race with politeness, or Monsieur Gustave values something worth paying attention to.
I decided such comical scenes had more to do with the latter, when the movie concludes and we see the hotel in its post-Monsieur Gustave 1960s state.
The original pink and ornate facade of the hotel is replaced with a dull grey exterior and, we see a frame of the once grand and golden elevators in their current state:

![]({{site.url}}/assets/elevator_new.png)

The first emotion that comes to mind when faced with this contrast is certainly loss.
Yet placing your finger on exactly what was lost is not so easy.
The key is in realizing that the prominence of the safety sign 'DO NOT USE ELEVATOR IN CASE OF FIRE' is not accidental.
What is being communicated here is that the Hotel Budapest was not simply lost to erosion and time, it was traded for expedience, pragmatism and safety.
The new and improved Hotel Budapest is certainly safer and easier to maintain, but perhaps in the process we traded a grand hotel for a mere building.
Looking at the architecture around my neighbourhood quickly confirmed that this negotiation was not just being played out in movies.

How is it that hundreds of years ago, when resources were exponentially more scarce and mere survival was a huge burden, did people sacrifice so much to add seemingly useless, and ironically celebratory details to their architecture?
(Of course I'm nowhere near the first to reflect on this [Sir. Roger Scruton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Be_a_Conservative) is an authority here.)? 

Taking a hint from the Grand Budapest, I make the case here that 1) the purely aesthetic state of affairs induced by certain COVID policies should be a part of the facts we consider, and 2) that we should place considerable value on them when deciding on future policies. 

I can think of three dimensions along which we might object to the permanent use of masks and similar policies.
The most immediate to consider would be a pragmatic one.
Assuming that we have identified these policies as helping preserve life, we then ask, is the policy low-cost enough and sustainable to maintain in perpetuity?
For the majority of new COVID measures, the answer is yes.
Masks are (arguably) a minor annoyance, QR codes can be easily generated and checked in microseconds (and if [done properly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) preserve privacy) vaccinations can be deployed at scale and with very little waiting time, tests are getting faster, and all of this may very well save some number of lives.
While all of these add up to somewhat minor inconveniences to people's daily lives, we can grant the life-preserving benefits outweigh the cons here.
This alone makes the policies quite sticky. Once the infrastructure is in place, and people are growing accustomed we become aware only of the risk of undoing them.
Next, we can look along the rights and freedoms dimension.
Here it is clear that carrying out these measures would represent significant limitations on natural rights, facilitate further encroachment, and make the policy undesirable under most people's values. 
Although I agree with such objections, I think this is missing the point.
That being, why do we care to fight for the preservation things like the right to not wear a mask in the first place?
If we didn't care about these rights for some reason other than their being rights, I don't think there would be as much controversy around these discussions. 
Finally, arguing along this axis carries a lot of political baggage so it is best if we can find a deeper and hence more unifying dimension.
This leaves the aesthetic dimension; is beauty adequately sustained under this state of affairs?
In 'How to be a Conservative', Sir Roger Scruton equates the experience of beauty with an acute sense of belonging in the world, and by that token, ugliness with the feeling of alienation: 

> [Hence] our human need for beauty is not simply a redundant addition to the list of human appetites. It is not something that we could lack and still be fulfilled as people. It is a need arising from our metaphysical condition, as free individuals, seeking our place in an objective world. We can wander through this world, alienated, resentful, full of suspicion and distrust. Or we can find our home here, coming to rest in harmony with others and with ourselves. And the experience of beauty guides us along this second path: it tells us that we are at home in the world, that the world is already ordered in our perceptions as a place fit for the lives of beings like us.

If we were to assign a feeling to the set of covid-related policies, alienation certainly comes to mind.
It is a fact that a world without faces, hugs, handshakes, with limits on gathering sizes, curfews, testing, contact tracing, where documents are demanded at cultural venues (not surprisingly, the most stressful scenes of The Grand Budapest are when Monsieur Gustave and Zero are being asked for their papers on the train) is, an ugly one, and one that does not properly sustain human life.
Is not the grey building in the above photo not a masked version of the one beside it?
So long as we believe in a human nature, we can say under any set of circumstances that each of these policies is a ubiquitous monument to fear, distrust, and vanity.
I say this with the aim of establishing a set of facts that most will agree are true.

Given these facts, comes the question of value.
Of course, under _certain_ states of affairs, such measures can indeed be desirable or at least necessary.
Without going into the current state of affairs, I address some extreme examples.
What do we make of the objection: 'Is a single life worth sacrificing for the sake of this 'aesthetic' value?'
Of course I can't provide an exact answer here other than to say that whether we like it or not, we are already making this kind of choice, and so we may as well contemplate as large a fact set as reasonable.
It is not unlikely that the policy which saves the most lives is the one where entire nations live in literal prisons. 
Clearly we can't let the principle of safety be our only guiding light, and most of us already see value in some kind of balance.
When our intuitions tell us the balance under threat, I propose we notice that this is not the first time this happens.
As I try to point out here with the architecture and film examples,  we can see this process unfolding throughout our culture, most fundamentally with the 'man does not live by bread alone' assertion. 
In this setting, we whould be wise to 'give our ancestors a vote', as Chesterton would say, and I believe they would tell us to not underestimate the aesthetic.
I believe that Monsieur Gustave was not merely a vain man, and that the architects and masons of old Europe did not toil out of boredom; rather they were demonstrating the value of celebrating our humanity even when it is costly.
If we forget to keep this in mind, the small but aesthetic details of our lives that make us human become vulnerable to attack.
Slowly but surely, the temptation of fear and misplaced pragmatism peels back the facades and we find ourselves surviving, albeit in, 'drab', grey prison to use M. Gustave's words.

> Pragmatism is a matter of human needs; and one of the first of human needs is to be something more than a pragmatist. - GK Chesterton 
 
It is through this lens that I think we can find some common ground with those that insist on the departure of the dehumanizing policies that have visited our lives.
Those trying to do away with a unidimensional focus safety are not acting selfishly rather, as  put it, they are expanding the domain of value and seeing viruses beyond COVID.

Whether or not 'masks & co' are indeed necessary evils is a personal value judgement, but I pray we do not let expedience make us forget that we are nonetheless paying a price.
