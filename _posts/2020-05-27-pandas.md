# Data in Python: Intro to Pandas & a bit of Seaborn :panda_face: :ocean: 

(Wrote these notes for McGill's course COMP 598.)[HackMD version](https://hackmd.io/@dondraper/H1fBux2sL)

---

### Motivation :zap: 

* Tabular/matrix data (i.e. data entered in rows and columns of a table) is pervasive in many fields, including the life sciences :microscope: 
* The most widely used software for dealing with this kind of data is Microsoft Excel.

---

### Why use Python? :snake:

* I'll give three (four) reasons why you might want to try working with this kind of data in Python instead
    1. It's free. :money_with_wings: 
    2. Automation and complex manipulations is much easier :pie: 
    3. Seamlessly integrate with the rest of your Python tools (e.g. database management, machine learning training, etc.) :chart_with_upwards_trend: 
    4. Clicking on buttons hurts :hospital: :mouse: :no_entry_sign: 

---

### Objectives :goal_net: 

1. Loading a dataset in Pandas
2. Inspecting it
3. Basic manipulations
4. Visualization

:::danger
* These libraries are super extensive.
* This is not an exhaustive coverage of pandas, this is just to get a small taste and become accustomed to learning from [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to best suit your needs.
:::

---

### Getting a Dataset

* I browsed [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) for some interesting COVID-related datasets (of course)
* We'll be using the [COVID by US county](https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset) dataset.

::: danger
**Disclaimer**: This is a real dataset, but the following visualizations and statistics are purely for illustration purposes, not as a real analysis of COVID.
:::
---

:::info
1. Download the **CSV** file (Comma Separated Values). A CSV is basically a text version of an Excel Table.
2. Place the file in a folder `my_project/data/` (we'll be working in the `my_project` folder)
:::


---

### Loading the file in Python

:::info
Create a file in `my_project/` called `covid.py`
:::
* If the source file is a CSV. [doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html?highlight=read_csv#pandas.read_csv)

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../data/covid.csv')
```

---

* If the source file is an Excel File. [doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html)

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('../data/covid.xls')
```

---


### DataFrames

* The core object that Pandas uses is called a DataFrame.
* We loaded our data into a DataFrame called `df`
* This is object stores the table data and supports most of the needed functionality.
* Let's take a look, using the `head` method which prints the first few rows of the table.

---

```python
print(df.head())
```

::: warning

```
         date     county       state     fips  cases  deaths
0  2020-01-21  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0
1  2020-01-22  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0
2  2020-01-23  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0
3  2020-01-24       Cook    Illinois  17031.0      1       0
4  2020-01-24  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0
```
:::

* Each row is a day with number of deaths and cases for each US county.
---

### Selections: Columns

* To get a list of columns

```python
print(df.columns)
```

::: warning
```
Index(['date', 'county', 'state', 'fips', 'cases', 'deaths'], dtype='object')
```
:::

* To get a single column

```python
dates = df['date']
print(dates)
```

Output:

```
0         2020-01-21
1         2020-01-22
2         2020-01-23
3         2020-01-24
4         2020-01-24
5         2020-01-25
...
```
* To get multiple columns

```python
print(df[['date', 'county']])
```
---

### Selections: Row

* To select a specific row, we use the `iloc` attribute. [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)

```python
print(df.iloc[2])
```

::: warning


```
date      2020-01-23
county     Snohomish
state     Washington
fips           53061
cases              1
deaths             0
Name: 2, dtype: object
```
:::
---

* You can then select columns within a row

```python
print(df.iloc[2]['date'])
```

::: warning

```
2020-01-23
```
:::

---

### Advanced Selection

* Row and column selection methods are very extensive and powerful. You should really read the [docs]() for a full understanding.
* Here is an example of getting the rows where deaths exceed cases by at least a factor of 2
* `.loc` is a powerful attribute which can take a condition on the column values to filter the rows.


```python
print(df.loc[df['deaths'] > df['cases'] * 2 ])
```
::: warning
```
              date   county         state  fips  cases  deaths
26292   2020-04-02  Unknown    California   NaN      0       1
28473   2020-04-03  Unknown       Arizona   NaN      0       4
29475   2020-04-03  Unknown     Minnesota   NaN      0       3
29803   2020-04-03  Unknown      New York   NaN     37     608
30135   2020-04-03  Unknown  Pennsylvania   NaN      0       1
30475   2020-04-03  Unknown          Utah   NaN      0       3
```
:::

---

### Adding columns

* Maybe we want to flag certain counties with lots of cases.

```python
df['hot'] = df['cases']> 100
print(df.head())
```

::: warning
```
         date     county       state     fips  cases  deaths    hot
0  2020-01-21  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0  False
1  2020-01-22  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0  False
2  2020-01-23  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0  False
3  2020-01-24       Cook    Illinois  17031.0      1       0  False
4  2020-01-24  Snohomish  Washington  53061.0      1       0  False
```
:::

---

### Writing DataFrames

* Let's say we want to publish our DataFrame with the `hot` column.
* We simply write it to a new CSV file which can be loaded later.


```python
df.to_csv('new_data.csv')
#or to excel format
df.to_excel('new_data.xls')

```

---


### Grouping 

* Maybe we want to know averages for the columns  **per state**
* the `groupby` method comes in handy here.

```python
#groupby object
state_grouped = df.groupby(['state'])
#new dataframe
means_df = state_grouped.mean()
```

::: warning
```
                       state          fips        cases      deaths       hot
0                    Alabama   1067.804565    95.768957    3.544569  0.222011
1                     Alaska   2148.606250    23.179455    0.465347  0.059406
2                    Arizona   4014.058216   411.876394   18.223048  0.372677
3                   Arkansas   5075.446098    37.349700    0.763608  0.077983
4                 California   6058.734863   671.394359   25.821298  0.382446
5                   Colorado   8062.313048   206.642279   10.232297  0.233342
```
:::

:::info
The logic behind grouping is a bit involved so I suggest reading the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).
:::

---

### Sorting

* Which states have the most daily deaths on average?

--- 

```python
print(means_df.sort_values(by=['deaths'], ascending=False)[['state', 'deaths']])
```

::: warning
```
                       state      deaths
33                  New York  274.444252
31                New Jersey  212.262184
6                Connecticut  171.599364
22             Massachusetts  152.209790
8       District of Columbia  140.775000
41               Puerto Rico   58.486486
```

---

:::

* I used the [`sort_values`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html) method with `ascending=False` for a decreasing sort by `deaths`
* Then I print the `state` and `deaths` columns.

---

### Plotting with Seaborn :ocean: 

* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a _wrapper_ on top of matplotlib which works nicely with DataFrames.



---

### Deaths per Day

* Let's compare deaths over time between three states.
* Notice the use of [`isin()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isin.html) to filter rows whose column values are within a list of accepted values.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

g = sns.lineplot(x="date", y="deaths", hue="state" data=df.loc[df['state'].isin(['New York', 'New Jersey', 'California'])])
plt.show()
```

::: spoiler
```python
#I used this to get rid of some x-ticks for easier reading.
for ind, label in enumerate(g.get_xticklabels()):
    if ind % 30 == 0:  # every 30th label is kept
        label.set_visible(True)
    else:
        label.set_visible(False)
```

---

### Mortality by State

* Let's do one more.
* Let's group by state again and instead of averaging take totals (sum)
* We also add a new column called `mortality`

```python
tot = df.groupby(['state'], as_index=False).sum()
tot['mortality'] = tot['deaths'] / tot['cases']
df = df.sort_values(by='mortality', ascending=False)
sns.barplot(x='state', y='mortality')
```
