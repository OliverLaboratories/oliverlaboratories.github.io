This is my first 'real' blog post. 

I did a workshop recently to introduce Python programming to graduate students in Biology at McGill University. I designed the workshop assuming no previous knowledge of Python and trying to set up the basics to build towards Python for data science. 

Anyone who is new to Python can follow this workshop and get a very complete idea of the fundamentals of Python. 

Upcoming notebooks will cover more specialized applications of Python inculding Pandas, Seaborn, and Numpy.

All the necessary files are in the original notebook repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/cgoliver/Notebooks/tree/master/Intro_to_Python). You will find a version of the notebook with the suffix `_work.ipynb`. This version is written with 'fill in the blanks' so you can work through the notebook in a more interactive manner.

Hope you enjoy it! Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
