Given a set of $d$ dimensional real-valued observations $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N\}$, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor Density estimate $\hat{f}(x)$ for a given observation $x$ is given by the fraction of points in the sample within a sphere of radius $R_k$. We choose the radius to be the distance from $x$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor. Finally, the ratio is scaled by the volume of the $d$-dimensional sphere, $V^d$ so we have:

$$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{k}{N} \cdot \frac{1}{V_d^k}$$,

where $V_d^k = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2 + 1)}R_k$.
