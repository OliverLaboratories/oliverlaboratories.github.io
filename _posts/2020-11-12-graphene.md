title: My Guide to De-Googling Your Phone

A few months ago I decided to `de-Google` my phone.
I had no strong reason to do it, other than for the novelty of it.
It also didn't really make sense to me that my Google account should be tied to my entire device.
Of course, doing this comes with some significant user-friendliness tradeoffs.
So here's a list of tools that I use to make that tradeoff as painess as possible.
I always opt for free and open source software (FOSS) when possible.
This is an ongoing post, I'll add updates as I come across them.


### Operating System: [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)

The most important step was to install an Android OS that does not have any Google dependencies.
Edward Snowden, a hero of mine, [recommended Graphene OS](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/d7bypn/even_edward_snowden_recommends_this_os/) as an open source OS with strong privacy and security features. 
What's nice about Graphene is that it runs on Pixel devices, so no need to get a [pinephone](https://store.pine64.org/), and it can run any Android app (modulo any Google Services dependencies).
I'm not an OS guy so I can't say much about the core features but one of them seems to be addressing [memory allocation](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) to reduce attack surface. 
The installation process was quite easy.
I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc&t=29s) tutorial since it was my first time installling an OS on a phone.
At the end you get something that looks identical to stock Android which is what you get with any Pixel phone.
You will notice that you don't need to provide a Google account when setting up the device, and there is no Google Play store, or any of the other Google apps that are hard-installed.

### Messaging: [Signal](https://www.signal.org/)

Another Snowden [recommendation](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/edward-snowden-signal-encryption-privacy-messaging/). 
Also FOSS. 
I use Signal for all my private messaging, and I've managed to bother all of the people I message regularly toalso use it.
It's a bit of a downgrade from the FB Messengers of this world in terms of user experience (but overall extremely solid). 
The project is gaining a lot of steam and features keep improving. 
Also it's a small price to pay for having private messages be actually private.
You can do video calls 1-1, group messaging with tagging, desktop app, etc.


### App Store: [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)
