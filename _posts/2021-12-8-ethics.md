I recently came across a peer-reviewed [article](https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/early/2021/10/20/medethics-2020-107026.full.pdf) called 'The Ethics of Vaccine Refusal' in *BMJ Medical Ethics* written by Michael Kowalik.
The work is aimed at determining whether one has a moral obligation to be vaccinated, and with that comes the discussion of whether coercion to be vaccinated is justifiable.
No direct mention of COVID is made in the paper but said situation is understood to be in the background as motivation.
With the aim of better understanding the paper's claims, and my own thoughts, this is my attempt at breaking down and commenting on the article.
I will structure this somewhat like a Question-Answer conversation where possible.


## Disclaimer

I am not an expert in medicine or ethics.

### Problem setup

* We assume that a pathogen is present in the population which poses some level of risk on the general population (this is a stronger assumption that data implies for COVID where risk is heavily stratified by age and specific factors)
* We assume that a vaccination exists and is widely available which is *effective* and *safe*.
	* *effective*: the vaccine reduces risk posed by symptomatic infection of the pathogen in the recipient of the vaccine. We do not make assumptions about the source of this protection (it could come from reducing the probability of transmission, infection, or harmful symptoms). 
	* *safe*: the vaccine poses a minor (but non-zero) risk to the recipient.

### *Does everyone who can be vaccinated have a moral obligation to be vaccinated?*


The author calls this obligation OTV, for 'Obligation to Vaccinate'.
Note that there are two situations under which OTV is examined:

1. The protection of those who cannot be vaccinated 
2. The protection of public health at large (overcrowding hospitals, vulnerable populations, etc.)

If neither of these conditions are the case, OTV does not stand on solid ground. 
Take two fictional characters, Alice, and Bob. 
Alice wishes to not be vaccinated (we choose to respect her wishes and do not inspect her personal reasons for this desire), and Bob is willing to be vaccinated. 
If we assume that the vaccine is safe and effective, we can satisfy both Alice and Bob without the need for coercion since Bob will take the vaccine, and Alice's wishes will be respected. 
Therefore, in this context the use of coercion will be strictly gratuitous and discriminatory to Alice's individual autonomy.
As will be seen later, this is also a desirable state of affairs for Bob since in this situation he will also live in a world where he is safe from the disease *and* free from coercion (an intrinsically desirable condition).
There is also the case where Bob wishes to not be vaccinated and instead wants Alice to be vaccinated in order to protect himself.


### *Does the prevention of potential disasters caused by non-vaccination justify the use of force to compel vaccination?* 

A [previous work](https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/44/1/37.full.pdf?casa_token=h17mfjtUMfMAAAAA:EnuWb_n2BN-y_uQGkUCPVdclN8z0owskkCHzu-RP_RoRnHSo40ZIzqCprNigIJ-NB-FRR_owpaZSrQ) provides a logical 'proof' that the above statement is true. 

1. The vaccine is widely available, has a low probability of harming the taker, and prevents serious illness from the pathogen. 
2. If a majority of people refuse the vaccine, a disaster ensues (general public health suffers, or many individuals are put at risk)
3. Individual freedoms can be overridden to avoid disasters. Therefore,
4. 'It is permissible to force individuals to receive the vaccine' (OTV)


Kowalik's answer to this question is no.
He notes that the proof above relies on two unfounded assumptions:

* There is a strong burden of proof to show that non-vaccination will necessarily cause the disaster, and vaccination is the only way to avoid the disaster. 
* No larger disaster will be caused by forcing vaccination.

What could these 'worse disasters' look like?
Here, the author introduces the notion of 'a life worth living'.
As discussed in one of my [previous blog posts]() we can easily imagine situations where for the 'sake of living (being alive)' we create a world not worth being alive in.
We can easily imagine that taking safety as the sole guiding principle would require the stripping of so many natural rights that life begins to resemble imprisonment, and furthermore no longer resembles life.
For this reason, Kowalik employs the same language as many arguments for vaccinations which rely on principles of harm reduction to say that vaccine coercion constitutes a real harm to life.
To avoid these 'prisons', we generally adopt the principle that the quality or desirability of any policy should pay a *penalty* proportional to the degree to which it strips people of their natural rights.

The natural rights in question here are described in the paper as 'body autonomy' (my body my choice).
Similarly to freedom of speech, this right is self-evident.
We don't force people to walk around with helmets 24/7 even though it will certainly reduce head injuries because it pays a hefty penalty for limiting bodily autonomy.
Nevertheless, we can certainly debate whether limitations to this freedom ought to be imposed albeit while always considering this 'penalty'.
Therefore it is possible that these penalties can be large enough or accumulate fast enough so that a disaster is inevitable. 

So in the case where we prevent harm to Bob by forcing Alice to be vaccinated, we have to consider that we have also harmed Alice in the process.
Moreover the harm of coercing Alice to be vaccinated is concrete and immediate, giving it a larger weight than the potential harm to Bob of an unvaccinated Alice which only exists probabilistically. 
On the subject of a probabilistic harm (aka a risk), we have to also note that the protection conferred by a vaccine is never absolute.
Rather, all we can say about an individual that is vaccinated is that there is some (hopefully low but never zero) probability that they will harm someone.
Vaccinated Alice is only a strictly greater risk to Bob than vaccinated Eve if Alice and Eve have exactly identical lifestyles and immune systems.
This is to say that if Eve is exposed to many more people than unvaccinated Alice, or has a lower chance or responding to vaccinations innately, or has sufficiently prolonged and proximal contact with Bob, it is very possible that Eve is a greater danger than Alice.
These details are raised is made so that a fair 'balancing of harms' can be developed and to show that it is not at all a straightforward exercise.
With all of that in mind we can ask, is the risk to Bob (who may or may not be vaccinated) so great that the harm to Alice is justified, and is this the only way that the risk can be averted?

Side note:

Here, I believe there is an assumption that the existence of a moral obligation to be vaccinated is equivalent (or implies) a justification for the use of force to have people vaccinated. 
However, there are cases where moral obligations may exist but not a justification for the use of coercion to enforce that moral obligation. 
Freedom of speech comes to mind. 
The moral obligation against gratuitously insulting people certainly exists, but the use of legal action to enforce this moral obligation will likely tread of protections of freedom of speech.
This is just to note that the paper quickly jumps from moral obligation to focusing on the justifiability of vaccine coercion.
