Every attempt to find plan and purpose and respectable rationality in the universe, whether on a supernatural or a merely naturalistic basis, is bound to end in absurdity, and of the two the naturalistic explanations are the most absurd. Perhaps the song of birds is "explainable" simply as a device for sexual attraction; perhaps the radiant wings of insects are no more than protective colouring; perhaps the beauty of the morning-glory is merely to entice the bee, appealing no doubt to his acute aesthetic appreciation of colour and form. Perhaps. But if the aim of so much splendour is merely to stimulate the sexual process of purely instinctual organisms, the mountain has laboured and brought forth a mouse.<br>

St. Paul made it clear that Christian morality is an art and not a science; it only proceeds from a new Life and not from a new law. One may master all the rules of grammar but fail to be a good writer for lack of anything to say. One may master all the rules of conduct but fail to be a Christian for lack of love. Mere obedience to a law will never of itself produce love, because love is the very life of God and there is no system or set of rules whereby one can become its posessor. Thus the mission of Christ was not to teach a new moral law. there was nothing particularly original in his moral principles, all of which may be found in earlier Jewish literature or in the precepts of other and older religions. The mission of Christ was to bring into human consciousness a new life and a new power which will make it possible not only to carry out the old precepts but also to reform them.<br>
