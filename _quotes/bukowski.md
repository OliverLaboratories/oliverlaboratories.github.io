Get a large typewriter and as the footsteps go up and down outside your window Hit that thing hit it hard Make it a heavyweight fight Make it the bull when he first charges in And remember the old dogs who fought so well: Hemingway, Celine, Dostoevsky, Hamsun. If you think they didn’t go crazy in tiny rooms just like you’re doing now Without women without food without hope Then you’re not ready. Drink more beer. There’s time. And if there’s not that’s all right too.<br>
