(under construction)

I am leading a research group as Project Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry.

Many real-world depend on __structural__ properties to operate.
A prominent example of this phenomenon is the realtionship between structure and function in biomolecules.
The spatial arrangement (geometry/structure) of biomolecules tells us a lot about which kinds of interactions are favorable and therefore which biological functions are accessible to DNA/proteins/RNA. 
As we gain access to more and more data on structured objects we need to develop algorithms capable of extracting these structure-function insights in a scalable manner. 



# Open Positions

We are looking for a highly motivated **PhD student** interested in working at the intersection of structural biology, deep learning and pattern mining on graphs.
