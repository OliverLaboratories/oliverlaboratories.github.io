I am leading a research group as Project Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry.

Many real-world systems exhibit __structural__ properties that are strongly linked to the way they operate.
A prominent example of this phenomenon is the realtionship between structure and function in biomolecules.
The spatial arrangement (geometry/structure) of biomolecules tells us a lot about which kinds of interactions are favorable and therefore which biological functions are accessible to DNA/proteins/RNA. 
Social networks, ecological food webs, also feature properties such as small-worldness, logical subunits, blabla which provide clues as to the forces shaping these networks.
As we gain access to more and more data on structured objects we need to develop algorithms capable of extracting these structure-function insights in a scalable manner. 



# Open Positions

We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student interested in working at the intersection of structural biology, deep learning and pattern mining on graphs.
