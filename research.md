# Data-driven structure function group

I am leading a research group as Project Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry.

Many real-world systems exhibit __structural__ properties that are strongly linked to the way they operate.
A prominent example of this phenomenon is the realtionship between structure and function in biomolecules.
The spatial arrangement (geometry/structure) of biomolecules tells us a lot about which kinds of interactions are favorable and therefore which biological functions are accessible to DNA/proteins/RNA. 
Social networks, ecological food webs, also feature properties such as small-worldness, logical subunits, blabla which provide clues as to the forces shaping these networks.
As we gain access to more and more data on structured objects we need to develop algorithms capable of extracting these structure-function insights in a scalable manner. 
This is the big picture focus of my group at the Department of Machine Learning and Systems Biology at the Max Planck Institute.
Below I go into more detail on the different research areas we cover.


## Automated graph mining

When structure arises from interactions or relationships in the underlying object (e.g. a molecule) we can capture a great deal of the necessary information as graphs, giving us access to a rich library of algorithmic tools developed for graphs.
