The problem is called 'Frequent Subgraph Pattern Mining' (FSPM) in which a single graph is mined for the most frequent small graph patterns. 
A *pattern set* for a fixed size $k$ is the set of all possible *connected* graphs with up to $k$ vertices.
Using a specific frequency definition, the tool is able to prune *pattern space* to compute exact patterns with a large frequency.
The algorithm is limited to working on a single graph.
