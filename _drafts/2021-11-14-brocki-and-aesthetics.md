> “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” - Fyodor Dostoevsky

It is undeniable that sacrifices of many forms have been made in the face of the COVID situation.
We have certainly made financial sacrifices, many would say that we have made sacrifices of liberty, health, sovereignty, spending time with loved ones, etc.
I write this to argue that there is a dimension along which we are making considerable sacrifices yet is being overlooked, and that is the dimension of aesthetics.

First, a preamble to set up some common language for the rest of the discussion. 
Before undertaking any sacrifice we implicitly or explicitly crunch some numbers to decide whether such a sacrifice is worth making.
We hope that when doing this, we are aware of all the relevant facts, and have sound judgement to digest these facts and turn them into action.
I would like to put this in a slightly mathematical framework purely because I think it can help people discuss controversial topics such as this one more productively. 

We can say that any individual or collective action stems from a decision that we make given a set of facts and values.
It is important to note that there are two distinct categories involved here: facts and values.
Values are not facts and facts are not values.
Facts are observations we make about the current state of the world (e.g. it is raining outside, implementing policy X will reduce crime by Y).
On the other hand, nowhere in the world do we observe values.
This is because values are beliefs about what the world _ought_ to look like, i.e. a desire for set of facts that may or not be the current set of facts.
Therefore, by definition values cannot themselves be facts, we can't find them in the world.
This automatically disqualifies science as a mechanism for taking moral decisions, something which to my great surprise, I have found myself having to explain to fellow scientists.
Science is a mechanism for deciding the truth value for a particlar choice of $ X $, but can never say anything about what value should be assigned to it.
This is not to say that all choices of $ \Omega $ are equally 'good'.
We can act on faith to choose a guiding principle for generating value assignments to facts.
The key is that we are now in the domain of _faith_, and beyond the realm of empirical evidence or falsifiability.
Even setting out with a 'scientific' world view, if I say that I belive $ \Omega $ should be chosen so as to maximize the survival of the species, I am saying _on faith_ that I think the survival of the species is a desirable aim.
We may observe a particular person behaving under a set of values (i.e. someone who values food highly will likely be found eating a lot of the time), but then we are observing a fact.

In a decision-making process, we can assign a _value_ which we can think of as the degree to which a givenu fact matters to us in the context of the decision at hand.
So for a set of facts $X = \\{x_1, x_2, .., x_N \\}$ we generate a corresponding set of values $\Omega = \\{ \omega_1, \omega_2, .., \omega_N \\}$ based on our own internal moral compass.
The ultimate decision is some combination of each fact, scaled by how much weight we assign to it through our values.

$$ \text{DECISION}(\Omega,X) = \textrm{sign} \big( w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 +  .. + w_N x_N \big) $$

Once we've combined all the facts (in this example, by means of a simple sum), the quantity that comes out can be used to make a decision.
Here, our decision is given by the sign of the combined values.

A simple example. 

It is raining, and need to decide whether I should run upstairs to get my umbrella but I'm running late for work. 
I begin a decision process and need to evaluate two possible sets of facts; I go back for my umbrella or I do not. In the case where I do the set of facts is:

The facts (we arbitrarily encode as $ x = 1 $ if true, $ x = -1 $ if false):

1. Will I be on time for work?: $ x_1 = -1 $.
2. Will I be more comfortable on my walk to work $ x_2 = 1 $.

If I care a lot about comfort, and not so much about my job, I might take these facts and generate the value set: $\Omega = \\{ \omega_1 = 0, \omega_2 = 1 \\} $.
So the outcome is $$ \text{sign}(0 \cdot -1 + 1 \cdot +1) $$ which is positive, so I go back for the umbrella.
You can imagine applying the same analysis to the scenario where I do not fetch my umbrella and obtain a -1. 
You can also easily imagine that given the same set of facts, two people can come to opposing decisions.
As the problems we face become more complex, and involve more facts (dimensions) we can ask many people, each which would generate their own $ \Omega $ for the state of affairs and we usually start to observe patterns.
This is because the space of values is not uniformly populated.
Value space can often be explained in lower dimensional terms such as liberalism, conservatism, authoritarianism, etc (this is what the famous [political compass]() is trying to do) and can be shown to vary in space and time.
And in a much more careful and detailed manner, the subject of Jonathan Haidt's book [The Righteous Mind]().
As a side note, this is to say that we can also mistake a change in values for a change in appreciation of facts.
C.S. Lewis gives a very interesting example of this in [Mere Christianity]() with respect to the old custom of witch burning:

All of the above is just to say that I have recently been reminded that there is a set of facts which are overlooked in discussions of COVID policy.
Namely, the aesthetic dimension.
Having recently moved to Switzerland after nearly a lifetime of living in Canada, it is impossible to avoid seeing the clash between the decadent past and the utilitarian present manifesting itself in the architecture.
Walking down any street in Basel you will see a sprinkling of brutalistic apartment buildings with flat grey facades interspersed through streets of brightly colored and indulgently decorated buildings. 
How is it that hundreds of years ago, when resources were exponentially more scarce, survival was a huge burden, and lifespan was significantly shorter did people sacrifice so much to add seemingly useless details to their architecture?
It is very clear that something has changed in the $ \Omega $ of European architecture (of course I'm nowhere near the first to reflect on this [Sir. Roger Scruton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Be_a_Conservative) is an authority here.) 
With all of this in the background, I recently revisited [The Grand Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Budapest_Hotel) by Wes Anderson and was able to see the character of Monsieur Gustave in a new light.
In one line, the movie depicts the life and downfall of Monsieur Gustave, a hotel manager at the opulent Grand Budapest Hotel in fictional 1930s Austria.
Monsieur Gustave's life revolves around seeing that every detail of the hotel is perfect and packed with sophistication and beauty.
Through a series of events, Monsieur Gustave find himself in several misadventures including being chased by fascists, shootouts, prison escapes, and high speed alpine chases.
What stood out to me most is that even in situations where survival ought tobe the one and only set of facts with non-zero $ \omega $, he quite comically displays an insistence on superficial details.
One scene that stands out in this regard comes moments after Monsieur Gustave's escape from prison where he climbs out of a sewer and meets his sidekick Zero who was supposed to bring him supplies and help him get to safety.
While clearly stil under pursuit, he asks Zero how it is going with his love interest, Agatha.
To express his love for Agatha to Monsieur Gustave, Zero begins to recite some romantic verse.
During the recitation, Monsieur Gustave hears the prison guards approaching and _politely_ interrupts the poem with:

> Very good! I'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded. But remember where you left off because I insist you finish later.

This is someone who is either foolish to be wasting a precious head start in a deadly foot race with politeness for comedy, or Monsieur Gustave values something worth paying attention to.
I decided such comical scenes had more to do with the latter, when the movie concludes and we see the hotel in its post-Monsieur Gustave 1960s state.
The original pink and ornate facade of the hotel is replaced with a dull grey bauhous exterior and, we see a frame of the once grand and golden elevators in their current state:

![]({{site.url}}/assets/elevator_new.png)

The prominence of the safety sign 'DO NOT USE ELEVATOR IN CASE OF FIRE' is not accidental.
The feeling of loss is inevitable when we are shown the hotel in its current state, yet placing your finger on exactly what was lost is not so easy.
Going further, what is being communicated here is that the Hotel Budapest was not simply lost to erosion and time, it was traded for something else, something which was given value over something else.
Certainly the new Hotel Budapest is safer with is prominent safety warnings, and easy to maintain infrastructure but this sense of loss seems to tell us that we are dealing with a dilemma.
I find this sentiment that safety cannot be our guiding virtue repeated throughout Western culture.


When I see certain measures adopted as emergency responses to the pandemic such a mask wearing, isolation mandates, and vaccine pasports discussed as potential ['permanent measures'](https://time.com/5952051/masks-after-pandemic-ends/) I worry we are facing a similar tradeoff.
What's more worrisome is that we seem to not even see the tradeoff. 
So I make the case here that 1) the purely aesthetic state of affairs induced by certain COVID policies should be a part of the facts we consider, and 2) that we should place considerable value on them when deciding future policies. 


Why not continue with mask policies forever?
I can think of three dimensions along which we might object to this and similar propositions.
The most immediate to consider would be a pragmatic one.
Assuming that we have identified these policies as helping preserve life, we then ask, is the policy low-cost enough and sustainable to maintain in perpetuity?
For the majority of new COVID measures, the answer is yes.
Masks are (arguably) a minor annoyance, QR codes can be easily generated and checked in microseconds(and if [done properly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) preserve privacy) vaccinations can be deployed at scale and with very little waiting time, tests are getting faster, and all of this may very well save some number of lives.
While all of these add up to somewhat minor inconveniences to people's daily lives, we can grant the life-preserving benefits outweight the cons here.
Next, we can look along the rights and freedoms dimension.
Here it is clear that carrying out these measures would represent significant limitations on natural rights and make the policy undesirable under most people's choices of $\Omega$.
Although I do agree with such objections, I think this is missing the point, which is why do we care to fight for the preservation things like the right to not wear a mask?
(On that note, I do believe rights are with us by birth and thus only their removal needs to be justified.)
If we didn't care about these rights for some reason other than their being rights, I don't think there would be as much controversy around these discussions. 
Finally, arguing along this axis carries a lot of political baggage so it is best if we can find a deeper and hence more unifying dimension.
This leaves the aesthetic dimension; is beauty adequately sustained under this state of affairs?
In 'How to be a Conservative', Sir Roger Scruton equates the experience of beauty with an acute sense of belonging in the world, and by that token, ugliness with the feeling of alienation: 

> [Hence] our human need for beauty is not simply a redundant addition to the list of human appetites. It is not something that we could lack and still be fulfilled as people. It is a need arising from our metaphysical condition, as free individuals, seeking our place in an objective world. We can wander through this world, alienated, resentful, full of suspicion and distrust. Or we can find our home here, coming to rest in harmony with others and with ourselves. And the experience of beauty guides us along this second path: it tells us that we are at home in the world, that the world is already ordered in our perceptions as a place fit for the lives of beings like us.

If we were to assign a feeling to the set of covid-related policies, alienating certainly comes to mind.
A world without faces, hugs, handshakes, with limits on gathering sizes, curfews, contact tracing, where documents are demanded for cultural events meant to bring us together (it is not coincintal that some of the most stressful scenes of The Grand Budapest are when Monsieur Gustave and Zero are being asked for their papers on the train) is, an ugly world, and one that does not properly sustain human life.
Of course, under certain states of affairs, $X$, such measures can indeed be desirable.
This is why a proper and highly scientific determination of $X$ is crucial.
I can already anticipate the objection: 'Is a single life worth sacrificing for the sake of this 'aesthetic' value?'
Of course, I can't provide an answer here other than to say that whether we like it or not, this kind of choice cannot be avoided, and so we may as well contemplate the full set of facts.
Perhaps the policy which saves the most lives is the one where entire nations live in literal prisons and I can ask how many lives are worth sacrificing to abolish these prisons?
This leads to the question of how we should weigh the 'ugly' state of affairs that these policies come with?

Here, as I have been alluding, we must do as Chesterton says and 'give our ancestors a vote'.
I have to believe that Monsieur Gustave was not a vain man, and that the architects and masons of Europe did not toil out of boredom.

> Renunciation of love is possible only when you have learned to love. This is why, in a society without religion, we see emerging a kind of contagious hardness of heart, an assumption on every side that there is no tragedy, no grief, no mourning, for there is nothing to mourn. There is neither love nor happiness – only fun. In such circumstance, the loss of religion is the loss of loss. - Roger Scruton

In addition to that, there is an insistence in our culture to the present day (hence my choice of a recent film to anchor the discussion) that
'man does not live by bread alone'.

People that want to do away with this insistence on safety are doing so for the sake of a world that preserves some reverence for that which makes us human, as [Douglas Farrow](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2021/04/24/get-out-of-my-pub-on-vaccinating-the-young-and-other-bad-ideas/) put it. 
It is simply for the sake of rejecting a world where the 'DO NOT USE THE ELEVATOR' sign is now permanently worn on our faces and on every door we cross.
However, the point of this piece is not to propose a value set, but rather to point out a cost in the equation that we ought not to ignore.
