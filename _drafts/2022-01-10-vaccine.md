title: Why are you not vaccinated?

I offer here a possible answer to the question, "why are you not vaccinated?".
Of course, this is a loaded question; it being asked presupposes that 'being unvaccinated' is a state that requires justification.
Since to be unvaccinated is merely to be, granting validity to such a question essentially puts our very existence on trial.
Putting aside the fact that the question is stillborn, in these times the question is still better than no question.
The question is nonetheless an invitation to dialogue, and a suspension of the practice of a priori labeling and demonization (anti-vax, anti-science, or even [racist & mysogynist](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/trudeau-calls-unvaccinated-canadians-racists-misogynists-in-unhinged-interview/)). 
My aim with this piece precisely to make sure that when such a dialogue is opened, it is done so in the most productive way possible.
By productie, I do not mean that one is to convince anyone to change their ways, but rather to at least see a reasonable logical thread behind what is now a very unpopular position.
The argument proceeds by presenting 6 theses starting with the question at hand and, arriving at the affirmation that in fact there is a strong moral case for refusing vaccination.


1. *We have witnessed an escalating sequence of dehumanizing policies. To the degree which these policies are de-humanising they are also self-defeating.* 

If we are to transform our society to protect humanity from a foreign invader, we ought to have a very solid understanding of what truly constitutes humanity.
Lacking this undrestanding leaves many self-defeating paths (destroying humanity for humanity's sake) wide open.

Let us go a bit deeper for a moment.
We can all say that a virus is a threat to humanity.
Perhaps we can say a virus is a threat to humanity because it threatens life and well-being.
A more accurate statement would be to say that we are threatened by its capacity to limit our faculty of self-determination.
Of course, death is the ultimate barrier to self-determination, but seldom do we act merely in the name of pure survival.
Even the most Draconian measures that we have witnessed fall far short of strategies acting purely in the name of survival.
A highly-infectious virus that causes blindness in 100% of its is perhaps a much larger threat to humanity than one which kills 1%.
Natural afflictions such as pathogens limit freedom in so far as they hinder the ability to independently choose actions for ourselves, also known as self-determination.
In this context, it is plain to see that we generally accept self-determination to be an inherent good (although this statement requires proving, perhaps on religious grounds, it is still uncontroversial for the most part).
Just like a virus can strip us of our right to self-determination so can other people.
The virus is not a moral agent so we cannot call it to account for its actions.
Why is the virus not a moral agent?
We say that the virus is not a moral agent because it cannot have done otherwise, i.e. it lacks the faculty of self-determination.
To value humanity is the same as valuing self-determination.
Kant claims that this property is the foundation of human rights, and it is also the characteristic by which we define the essence of humanity. 


3. The latest escalation on this sequence came with vaccines which are being distributed against a background of positive and negative coercion.  
4. Vaccination status is meticulously tracked at an individual level. 
5. Refusal

Each thesis is meant to be as grounded in our objective experience as possible.
One may disagree as to whether

1. *In so far as we have rights, we are human.* Here is my attempt at an intuitive deriviation of what greater minds have already established (Kant). An unobjectionable truth about the human experience is  that we are limited. Because we are limited, by definition there will always exist more than we can apprehend. From this, it follows that if we are all limited beings, we will never have the knowledge to decree what someone else ought to do, lest it be discovered that in the great unknown lies a perfect proof to the contrary. We easily recognize that in the lottery all tickets are equal since there the unknown shows her face quite plainly. Perhaps now we arrived at a situation of equality, but not quite at rights. As humans, we have the remarkable ability to
