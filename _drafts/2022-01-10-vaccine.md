This is an attempt at the clearest and most productive answer I can present to the question, 'why are you not vaccinated?'.
A few preliminaries.
The question itself is loaded.
The question presupposes that 'being unvaccinated' is a state that requires justification.
Since to be unvaccinated is merely to be, granting validity to such a question essentially puts our very existence on trial.
Putting aside the fact that the question is stillborn, in these times the question is still better than no question.
The question is nonetheless an invitation to dialogue, and a suspension of the practice of a priori labeling and demonization (anti-vax, anti-science, or even [racist & mysogynist](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/trudeau-calls-unvaccinated-canadians-racists-misogynists-in-unhinged-interview/)).
