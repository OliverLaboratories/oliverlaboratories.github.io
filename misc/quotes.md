This is a live page containing some quotes that I find interesting.

> It ain't hard to hold  
> When it shines like gold  
> You'll remember me.  
> -- The Killers

This one has a very interesting structure.
You can read it as "It ain't hard to hold. When it shines like gold, you'll remember me."
Or as "It ain't hard to hold when it shines like gold. You'll remember me."
