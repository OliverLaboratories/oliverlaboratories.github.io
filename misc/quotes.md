This is a live page containing some quotes that I find interesting.

> It ain't hard to hold  
> When it shines like gold  
> You'll remember me.  
> -- The Killers


> To my thinking, miracles are never a stumbling block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief...Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.  
> Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov

> For socialism is not merely the labour question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount to Heaven from Earth but to set up Heaven on earth.  
> Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov

> In th emouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but in the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
> Proverbs 14:3
